Synchronized Scrolling Library
==============================

Synchronized Scrolling Library is a library that allows you to have a Synchronized scrolling effect in a view, similar to the one in the GMail app (when you open a conversation with multiple messages, you can scroll down and the senders info stay on top of screen), or in the Play Store App (when you want to download an app and it shows the permision screen).

You can see that effect here:
